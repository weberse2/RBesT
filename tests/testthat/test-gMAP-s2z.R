## Tests for the sum-to-zero (S2Z) reparametrization of the gMAP Stan model.
##
## See design/design-sum-to-zero-gmap.md, section 7 (validation ladder).
##
## Three tiers, cheapest first:
##
##   1. Pure R arithmetic and the analytic derivation. CRAN-safe.
##   2. Deterministic checks against the compiled Stan model through
##      `chains = 0` skeletons and `rstan::constrain_pars()`. The structural
##      invariants hold for *any* parameter vector, so they are asserted on a
##      chosen grid of unconstrained vectors rather than on posterior draws:
##      exact, free of Monte Carlo error, and able to reach extreme `tau`.
##   3. Cached MCMC fixtures, used only where the assertion is genuinely about
##      a distribution. Built by `make -j4 test-fixtures` from the recipes in
##      `tests/testthat/fixtures-mcmc-src/`.
